# Android Malware Detection

## Overview
This project is dedicated to developing a robust machine learning model, specifically a decision tree classifier, to identify and classify malware on Android devices. With the growing threat of malware in the Android ecosystem, timely and accurate detection has become a paramount concern. The project leverages the interpretability and ability of decision trees to handle intricate feature interactions.

## Data Source
The core of this project revolves around a comprehensive dataset that encompasses an array of features extracted from Android applications. These features encompass permissions, system calls, API calls, and more, which serve as essential input variables for training and evaluating the decision tree model.

## Target Variable
The target variable in this context is binary, assigning a label of 1 to malware-infected applications and 0 to goodware, representing non-malicious applications. This binary classification provides a clear and actionable outcome, enabling users to take immediate security measures.

## Feature Importance
Effective feature selection is a pivotal step in model development. We employ feature ranking techniques to identify the aspects of Android applications that have the most significant impact on the classification of malware versus goodware. This process helps us focus on the most critical attributes for accurate detection.

## Data Splitting
To rigorously assess model performance and avoid overfitting, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The decision tree classifier is trained on the training data and subsequently evaluated on unseen data to gauge its performance. This evaluation involves metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Modeling
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Decision trees are our primary modeling technique due to their interpretability and the ability to handle intricate feature interactions.
- **Logistic Regression (Baseline):** We employ logistic regression as a baseline model for comparison and evaluation purposes.

## Evaluation
- **Metrics:** The models' performance is assessed using a comprehensive set of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, providing a multifaceted view of their capabilities.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Model performance is visualized and further dissected using a confusion matrix, offering insights into false positives and false negatives.
